## Introduction

In this introduction, we quickly give an overview of how the PDMPFlux.jl package works, through a standard example.

Take the Sticky Zig-Zag Sampler [@Bierkens+2023] as an example.

1. `sampler = StickyZigZag(dim, ∇U)`

    This instantiates the sampler, an object of an `AbstractPDMP` subtype.

2. `output = sample_skeleton(sampler, N_sk, xinit, vinit)`

    This takes a sampler object, and returns a `PDMPHistory` object, by transforming the `PDMPState` object while pushing its snapshots into the `PDMPHistory` object.

## Directory Structure of `PDMPFlux.jl/src`

### `Composites.jl` {#sec-Composites}

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}


composites / constructs such as `BoundBox`, `PDMPState`, `PDMPHistory` are defined.
    
* `BoundBox` is basically a grid, together with the values on it, tailored to perform Poisson thinning. 3 constructors are defined in `UpperBound.jl` @sec-UpperBound.

  * `boundbox.grid` is the grid points. Let the dimension be `n_grid`, which is a field of any `AbstractPDMP` subtype.
  * The grid is equi-spaced, with the step size `step_size`.
  * `boundbox.box_max` has `n_grid - 1` elements
    $$
    \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{box\_max[i]}} = \max_{t \in [\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{grid[i]}}, \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{grid[i+1]}}]} \lambda(t),\qquad i\in[\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{n\_grid-1}}].
    $$
  * `boundbox.cum_sum` has `n_grid` elements, and
    $$
    \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{cum\_sum[i]}} = \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{box\_max[j]}}\times\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{step\_size}},\qquad i\in[\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{n\_grid}}].
    $$
    Note that it is not the cumulative sum of `box_max`, but the cumulative sum of the piecewise constant (upper bound) function represented by `box_max`'s:
    $$
    \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{cum\_sum[i]}} = \int^i_0\sum_{j=1}^{\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{n\_grid}-1}}1_{[\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{grid[j]}}, \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{grid[j+1]}})}(t)\cdot\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{box\_max[j]}}\,dt,\qquad i\in[\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{n\_grid}}].
    $$

* `PDMPState` is used to keep the position of the sampler, together with caracteristics and diagnostic information. The whole `SamplingLoop.jl` @sec-SamplingLoop is implemented as a collection of functions that modify the `PDMPState` object in place. In addition to the $(x,v,t)$ tuple, the fields include

  * methods specific to the sampler.
    * `state.rate` and `state.rate_vect` are the rate function and its vectorized version. These slots are determined after checking the field `pdmp.signed_bound` in `init_state()` in `AbstractPDMP.jl` @sec-AbstractPDMP.
    * `state.upper_bound_func()` takes $(x,v,t)$ and returns the `BoundBox` object. Basically, `state.upper_bound_func()` is the only field that differs among samplers.
    * `state.velocity_jump()` takes $(x,v,t)$ and returns the velocity vector after the PDMP's jump.
    * `state.flow()` takes $(x_0,v_0,t)$ and returns $(x_t,v_t)$, which indicates the PDMP's position after the time $t$ from $(x_0,v_0)$.

  * fields to facilitate the sampling loop.
    * boolean flags to indicate whether Poisson thinning proposal is accepted or not, which is used within `ac_step_with_proxy()` in the `SamplingLoop.jl` @sec-SamplingLoop.
    * proposed jump time `tp` and time already spent `ts`. They are using in `SamplingLoop.jl` @sec-SamplingLoop to conduct poisson thinning, where `tp` is the proposed jump time, and is added to `ts` when rejected.
    * `horizon` is passed to upper-bounding functions to create a `BoundBox` object.

  * statistics to diagnose the sampler dynamic.

### `sample.jl` {#sec-sample}

`sample.jl` contains functions, called by users, to start MCMC sampling. The `ProgressBar` package is used to be friendly to users.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}

`sample.jl` contains 2 functions, and `sample()` that calls them in sequel.

* `sample_skeleton() -> PDMPHistory` initializes the progress bar and `PDMPState` & `PDMPHistory` objects, using `init_state()` and `PDMPHistory()` constructor respectively. Then call `get_event_state()` in `SamplingLoop.jl` @sec-SamplingLoop for `iter::Int` times.
* `sample_from_skeleton() -> Matrix{Float64}` is a function that generates samples, which might subsequently be called by the plotting functions in `plot.jl`.

:::

### `SamplingLoop.jl` {#sec-SamplingLoop}

This module contains 10 functions. Some of them are summarized in the following figure:

![](Files/NewSamplingLoop.jpg){width="50%" fig-align="center"}

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}

The main loop for sampling is implemented here.

* `get_event_state() -> PDMPState` is the entering point from `sample.jl`.

  * There is only one thing in `get_event_state()`, i.e., callling `one_step_of_thinning()` until `state.accept` becomes `true`.

  * `get_event_state()` returns a `PDMPState` object with the field $(x,v,t)$ indicating where an accepted event happens, which is pushed to `PDMPHistory` back in `sample_skeleton()` in `sample.jl` @sec-sample.

* `one_step_of_thinning()` returns where simulation has completed up to, with `state.accept = false` if any proposal isnot accepted yet.

  * Firstly, it proposes the next jump event, by simulating `exp_rv` and calling `next_event(upper_bound, exp_rv) -> (tp, lambda_bar)`.

    * `upper_bound` is the `BoundBox` object, which is calculated by `state.upper_bound_func()` and the current state `(x,v,t)`.
    * `tp` is the proposed jump time.
    * `lambda_bar` is a upper bound, *with error*, for the rate function $\lambda$.

  * Secondly, it checks whether `tp <= state.horizon`.

    * If not, it calls `move_to_horizon()` and continues the loop `one_step_of_thinning()` inside `get_event_state()`.
    * If yes, it proceeds to `moves_until_horizon()`, where another loop, calling `ac_step()`, is performed until one of the following 2 happens
      * when `state.accept` becomes `true`, it gets out of the both loops.
      * when `tp > state.horizon`, it calls `move_to_horizon2()` to get out of `ac_step()` loop, and continues the loop `one_step_of_thinning()` inside `get_event_state()`.

* `ac_step()`, standing for acceptance-rejection step, is the core of Poisson thinning.

  * calculating the **acceptance rate** `ar`, *which might exceed $1.0$*.

    In that case, `erroneous_acceptance_rate()` is called to shrink the `horizon` by half, and then continues the `ac_step()` loop in `moves_until_horizon()` function. Shrinking `horizon` leads to a finer grid, since `n_grid` is fixed.

  * Otherwise, it performs the Poisson thinning using the proxy rate `lambda_bar`, in `ac_step_with_proxy()` call.
    * Within `ac_step_with_proxy()`, either `if_accept()` or `if_reject()` is called depending on the result of Poisson thinning, followed by `move_to_horizon2()` if accepted. Whether accepted or not is informed by `state.accept` flag, which will lead you out of all the loops.
    * In `if_accept()`, the flags are updated as `state.accept = true` & `state.accept = true`, getting out of both `ac_step()` loop and `one_step_of_thinning()` loop, with the correct $(x,v,t)$ stored in appropriate `state`'s fields, which is pushed to `PDMPHistory` back in `sample_skeleton()` in `sample.jl` @sec-sample.
    * `if_reject()` being called, we are still in the `ac_step()` loop in `moves_until_horizon()`, until acceptance or `tp > state.horizon`.

:::

### `UpperBound.jl` {#sec-UpperBound}

This module contains `next_event()` function and 3 constructors for `BoundBox` object, with the name of `upper_bound_**()`.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false" title="3 constructors for `BoundBox` object"}

```julia
upper_bound_**(func::Function, start::Float64, horizon::Float64) -> BoundBox
```

* `upper_bound_constant()` computes the constant upper bound for the function `func` over the interval `[start, horizon]`.

    Technically, it returns the `BoundBox` object, with just 2 grid points, `start` and `horizon`. The maximum value is searched by the Brent's algorithm via [`Optim.jl` package](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl).

* `upper_bound_grid()` computes a piecewise constant upper bound, using the `n_grid` grid points.

    The `box_max[i]` field is the maximum value of the three points in the interval `[grid[i], grid[i+1]]`, which are the values on the two edges `func(grid[i])`, `func(grid[i+1])`, and the intersection point of the two tangents on the two edges of the interval.

* `upper_bound_grid_vect()` is a `LinearAlgebra` implementation of `upper_bound_grid()`.

:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false" title="`next_event(boundbox, exp_rv)` takes `boundbox` to propose a next event time"}

```julia
index = searchsortedfirst(boundbox.cum_sum, exp_rv)
```

is performed to find the `index` that satisfies

$$
\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{exp\_rv}} \in \left[\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{cum\_sum[index-1]}}, \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{cum\_sum[index]}}\right).
$$

Finally, `t_prop` that satisfies

$$
\int^\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{t\_prop}}_0 \overline{\lambda}(t)\,dt = \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{exp\_rv}},
$$
where $\overline{\lambda}(t)$ is the piecewise constant upper-bounding function defined by
$$
\overline{\lambda}(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{n\_grid}-1}}1_{[\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{grid[j]}}, \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{grid[j+1]}})}(t)\cdot\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{box\_max[j]}}.
$$

`next_event()` returns the jump time `t_prop` and the corresponding upper bound value `upper_bound`, i.e.,
$$
\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{upper\_bound}} = \overline{\lambda}(\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{t\_prop}}) = \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{box\_max[index-1]}}.
$$

## Implementation of the Samplers

### Introduction

All samplers are defined as subtypes of `AbstractPDMP` in `Samplers/AbstractPDMP.jl` @sec-AbstractPDMP.

Different samplers have four different fields in `PDMPState` object, which are `upper_bound_func`, `rate`, `rate_vect`, and `velocity_jump`, as we learned in @sec-Composites.

The four special fields are initialized in the constructor defined in the respective `Samplers/<Name>.jl` module.

### `Samplers/AbstractPDMP.jl` {#sec-AbstractPDMP}

This module contains one line

```julia
abstract type AbstractPDMP end
```

and one function, whose signature is

```julia
init_state(pdmp::AbstractPDMP, xinit::Array{Float64}, vinit::Array{Float64}, seed::Int) -> PDMPState
```

This `init_state()` is basically a constructor for `PDMPState`, called in `sample_skeleton()` @sec-sample.

It is defined in `AbstractPDMP.jl` because the composite `PDMPState` must have different field values depending on the type of the argument `pdmp`.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false" title="`init_state()` mainly does two things"}

1. Check the field `pdmp.signed_bound` and modify the 3 fields `rate`, `rate_vect`, `refresh_rate` accordingly, which were already initialized in the respective constructor of `pdmp`.
2. Check the field `pdmp.grid_size` & `pdmp.vectorized_bound` and initialize the field `upper_bound_func` as one of the functions in the `UpperBound.jl` @sec-UpperBound module accordingly.

:::

The remaining special fields, `velocity_jump` and `flow` are defined, together with initialization of `rate` and `rate_vect`, in the sampler specific modules, to which we will turnin the following sections.

### `Samplers/ZigZagSamplers.jl`

In this module, the declaration

```julia
mutable struct ZigZag <: AbstractPDMP
```

is followed by the 2 constructors, `ZigZag()` and `ZigZagAD()`, whose signatures are

```julia
function ZigZag(dim::Int, ∇U::Function; refresh_rate::Float64=0.0, grid_size::Int=10, tmax::Union{Float64, Int}=2.0, 
                    vectorized_bound::Bool=true, signed_bound::Bool=true, adaptive::Bool=true)
function ZigZagAD(dim::Int, U::Function; refresh_rate::Float64=0.0, grid_size::Int=10, tmax::Union{Float64, Int}=2.0, 
                    vectorized_bound::Bool=true, signed_bound::Bool=true, adaptive::Bool=true, AD_backend::String="Zygote")
```

Notice the difference in `∇U` and `U` in the arguments.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false" title="In `ZigZag()` and `ZigZagAD()`, two fields are initialized"}

1. `flow` is defined as

  $$
  \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{flow}}\,(x_0,v_0,t) =(x_0+v_0t, v_0)
  $$

2. `rate_vect` is defined component-wisely as

    $$
    \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{rate\_vect[i]}}(x_0,v_0,t) = \max(0, \nabla U_i(x_0+v_0t)v_0),
    $$
    where $\nabla U=(\nabla U_1,\dots,\nabla U_d)^\top$ is the gradient $\nabla U:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$.

    `rate` is the sum of `rate_vect`, i.e.,

    $$
    \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{rate}}(x_0,v_0,t) = \sum_{i=1}^d \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{rate\_vect[i]}}(x_0,v_0,t).
    $$

    `signed_rate_vect` is a version of `rate_vect` without taking the `max` with $0$.

:::

Two flags `signed_bound` and `vectorized_bound` are `true` in default, in which case `signed_rate_vect` is used.

This is called the *signed strategy*, detailed in [Section 4.4.2 @Andral-Kamatani2024].

The `vectorized_bound` is also special to the Zig-Zag samplers.

### `Samplers/BouncyParticleSamplers.jl`

Similar to the Zig-Zag samplers, mutable struct `BPS` and 2 constructors `BPS()` and `BPSAD()` are defined.

Difference is that, in `BPS`, vectorization is not used, therefore `vectorized_bound=false` no matter what the user specifies.

Note that typically Bouncy Particle Samplers need nonzero refresh rate, therefore `refresh_rate=0.0` would result in erronous samples.

### `Samplers/ForwardEventChainMonteCarlo.jl`

Forward ECMC (Event Chain Monte Carlo) is a generalizatione of the Bouncy Particle Sampler, being free from the need of refreshing, substituting it with a 'informed' velocity jump.

Regarding the implementation, however, note there is an error in the pseudo-code of [@Michel+2020]'s paper, and in the implementation of the `pdmp_jax` package.

To sum it up, the velocity jump is implemented separately on $\mathbb{R}\nabla U$ and $(\mathbb{R}\nabla U)^\perp$. To the former, the velocity is newly sampled from the invariant distribution directly, while to the latter, occasionally (tuned by `mix_p`) only two dimensions of them are changed. (If `ran_p=false`, they are swaped.)

As a result, the sampler loses ergodicity and confined to a certain subspace when, for example, $U$ is completely isotropic and the initial velocity is proportional to its contours.

### `Samplers/StickyZigZagSamplers.jl`

This module implements the Sticky Zig-Zag sampler, for variable selection with the spike-and-slab prior.

The sampler takes additional argument `κ`, which has to be positive `Float64` or `Inf`, determining (inverse) frequency of the sticking behaviour.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}

* In one step of `one_step_of_thinning_or_sticking_or_thawing()`, it is first checked whether the sampler crosses any axes by $\min(\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{tp}}, \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{tt}}, \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{horizon}})0$.
  * If it does cross, `move_to_axes_and_stick()` is called.
  * Else, $\min(\textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{tp}}, \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{tt}}) > \textcolor{purple}{\mathtt{horizon}}$ is checked.
    * If it is true, `move_to_horizon()` is called.
  * Else, `moves_until_horizon_or_axes()` is called.
    *
